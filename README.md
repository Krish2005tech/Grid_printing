The main aim of this is to allow for easy access to a 2d grid with x,y coordinates. It can be used to create a chess board, Maze or just anything you could think of with a grid. 

A sample output file has also been shared in the repo with name - output.png

#For customization :

*Change the variable x,y to alter the board size 

*Insert values in the _coords lists to get a particular pattern in a certain cell

*If you want to change the default cell filling then simply go to the end of print_board() functions and under the heading default change the empty_cell function to any desired functions.
